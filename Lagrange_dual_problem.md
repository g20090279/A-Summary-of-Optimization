- always convex, regardless the convexity of the primal problem
- weak duality and strong duality
- Slater's condition on strong duality
- refined Slater's condition on strong duality

# Duality Gap between Primal Problem and Dual Problem

- if primal problem is feasible, strong duality holds for all LPs
- if dual problem is feasible, strong duality holds for all LPs
- strong duality fails for all LPs only when the primal and dual problems are not feasible
