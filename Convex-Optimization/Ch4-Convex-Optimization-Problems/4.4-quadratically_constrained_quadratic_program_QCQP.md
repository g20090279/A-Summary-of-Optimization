For a quadratic program, where the objective function is convex quadratic while the constraint functions are affine, if the affine inequalities are replaced with quadratic inequalities, such quadratic program is called *quadratically constrained quadratic program* (QCQP)

$$\begin{aligned}
   \min\quad&(1/2)x^TP_0x+q_0^Tx+r_0\\
   \text{s.t.}\quad&(1/2)x^TP_ix+q_i^Tx+r_i\leq0,\quad i=1,\cdots,m\\
   &Ax=b,
\end{aligned}$$

where $P_i\in\mathbb{S}_+^n,i=0,1,\cdots,m$.
