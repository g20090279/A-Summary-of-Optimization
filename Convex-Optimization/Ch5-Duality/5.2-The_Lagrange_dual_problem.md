The advantages of transforming an optimization problem to its Lagrange dual problem

- The Lagrangian must be convex, whether the original optimization is convex or not.
- The Lagrangian dual problem gives the lower bound of the optimal value of the original problem.

Other properties of Lagrange dual problem are

- Strong duality (the optimal values from the Lagrange dual problem and original problem are equal) does not in general hold.
- The convexity of the original problem does NOT result  in the strong duality (therefore, beyond convexity, the conditions for strong duality are developed).
- Slater's theorem (condition for strong duality) needs the original problem to be convex.
