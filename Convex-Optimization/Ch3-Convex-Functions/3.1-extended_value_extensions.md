Since in the definition of convexity of a function, we consider only the values inside the domain of this function. Different functions may have different domains, and therefore we need to explicitly describe the domain when we talk about a convex function. If we can extend the definition of the original function so that the domain is the whole feasible set, say, the domain for a real function is the whole real number set $\mathbb{R}$ instead of a subset of it. We can do it by defining the values outside the function is infinitive, i.e. defining an extended-value extension $\tilde{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\cup\left\{\infty\right\}$ by

$$\tilde{f}(x)=\begin{cases}
f(x) & x\in\textbf{dom}f\\
\infty & x\notin\textbf{dom}f.
\end{cases}$$

Similarly, we can extend a concave function by defining it to be $-\infty$ outside its domain.
