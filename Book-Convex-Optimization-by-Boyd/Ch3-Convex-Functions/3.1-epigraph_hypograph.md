# Review: how to determine a function if it is convex or not

A basic principle to check if a function is convex or not is to use the definition of the convexity. Choose any two points in the points, check if the forming line segment lies above the function. In other words, you need to ensure the convexity exists for any two points.

Another straightforward method derived from the definition is to check if there is only one turn-around (from decreasing to increasing, or the other way around) in the curve.

Here, we are going to talk about the third way to verify the convexity of a function.

# The graph of a function

First of all, you need to draw out the function. Of course, it is easy to do if the function is one dimensional or even two dimensional. The plot of the function is called the *graph*. Mathematically speaking, the graph of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is defined as $\left\{(x,f(x))|x\in\textbf{dom}f\right\}$.

# The epigraph of a function is a set

The *epigraph* of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is defined as

$$\textbf{epi}f=\left\{(x,t)|x\in\textbf{dom}f,f(x)\leq t\right\}.$$

Note that the epigraph is a set, and in this case, it is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The extra one dimension comes from the combination of $t$.

# Why call this definition "epigraph"?

The graph is a set, such as the graph of a function is $(x,f(x))$. Another example for the graph is that the positive area between the function and $f(x)=0$ can be expressed as

$$\left{(x,t)|x\in\textbf{dom}f;f(x)\leq t\leq0\right}.$$

The prefix "epi" means above. Geometrically $\textbf{epi}f$ is the area above the function. Although $t$ is in $\mathbb{R}$, the set is empty for $t<f(x)$ due to the definition of the epigraph.

# Link between convex function and convex set

The third criterion to determine the convexity of the a function can be based on the epigraph. If its epigraph is convex, such a function is also convex.

# Concave function with "hypograph"

We can define the term *hypograph* for concave functions as the epigraph for convex functions. The prefix "hypo" means below, beneath, under. The hypograph includes the area below the function. Only if the hypograph of a function is convex, such function is concave.

# Conclusion

Nice, that we can check the convexity with another means.
