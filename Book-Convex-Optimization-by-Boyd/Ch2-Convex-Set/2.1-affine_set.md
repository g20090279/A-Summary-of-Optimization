# Definition of Affine Set

For a set $C$ which is a subset of the real number set, i.e. $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, if the line through any two different points $x_1,x_2\in C$ lies also in $C$, i.e. $\theta x_1+(1-\theta)x_2\in C$ where $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, the set $C$ is an ***affine set***. 

# More General Description of Affine Set

From the definition of affine set, the coeffients of any distinct two point are summed to one. This can be generalized to an arbitrary number of points in an affine set. Consider $k$ distinct points, $x_1,\cdots,x_k\in C$ and the coefficients $\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_k=1$, then the point $\theta_1x_1+\cdots\theta_k x_k$ also belongs to $C$.

# Remarks

- The coefficients $\theta_i$ is a real number, can be positive or negative or zero.
- A line must be an affine set, with "minimum" size (which means that no other points away from this line).
- A affine set must be **infinite**, since a line contains a infinite number of points.
