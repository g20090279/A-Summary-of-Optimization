# Definition of cone

A cone is a subset of a vector space closed under multiplication by a nonnegative scalar. 

**Definition**. A set $C$ is a *cone* (sometimes also called *nonnegative homogeneous*) if for every $x\in C$ and $\theta\geq0$ we have

$$\theta x\in C.$$

*Figure 1: cone set and convex cone.*

Why we call it "nonnegative homogeneous"? Note that a function is *homogeneous* if we have

$$f(\theta x_1+\theta x_2+\cdots+\theta x_n)=\theta^kf(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n),$$

where $\theta$ is a scalar.

There may be other definitions of a cone. For this definition, we have several properties of a cone

- A cone has an apex at $x=0$.
- A cone is NOT necessary to be convex.
- A ray is a cone (Figure 1 a)).
- A line is a cone (if $x1,x2$ are both in the cone where $x_1=-x_2$).
- A cone is called *pointed* if no line belongs to the cone, i.e., if $x_1\in C$ and $x_2=-x_1$, $x_2\notin C$. Figure 1 a) and b) are both pointed cone.

**Definition**. A cone $C$ is convex if for any $x_1,x_2\in C$ and $\theta_1,\theta_2\geq0$ we have

$$\theta_1x_1+\theta_2x_2\in C.$$

$C$ is also called *convex cone*.
