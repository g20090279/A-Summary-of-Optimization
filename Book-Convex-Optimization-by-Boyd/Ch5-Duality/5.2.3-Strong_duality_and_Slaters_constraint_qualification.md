# Primal and Dual Problems

We consider a convex constrained optimization problem in standard form:

$$p^\ast=\min_x : f_0(x) ~:~ Ax = b,\ f_i(x)\le0,\  i=1,\ldots,m,$$

where $f_0,\ldots,f_m : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are *convex* functions, $A\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}, b\in\mathbb{R}^p$ define the affine inequality constraints.

To this problem we associate the *Lagrangian*, which is the function $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with values

$$\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda,\nu) = f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \nu^T(Ax-b).$$

The corresponding dual function is the function $g:\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with values

$$g(\lambda,\nu) = \min_x:f_0(x)+\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i f_i(x)+\nu^T(Ax-b).$$

Note that the $\min$ in the above equation is sometimes replaced by $\inf$. Recall that the function $g$ is *concave* in $(\lambda,\nu)$ since it is piecewise infimum, and that it can assume $-\infty$ values. However, if $(\lambda,\mu)g$ is not a meaningful lower bound if it is $-\infty$. Therefore, we consider that its domain is $\textbf{dom }g:=\left\{(\lambda, \nu) ~:~ g(\lambda,\nu) > -\infty \right\}$.

Finally, the dual problem reads

$$d^\ast=\max_{\lambda\ge0,\ \nu}:g(\lambda,\nu).$$

Note that the sign constraints are imposed only on the dual variables corresponding to inequality constraints. Note also that there are (possibly) implicit constraints in the above problem, since we must have $(\lambda,\nu)$ in $\textbf{dom }g$.

# Strong duality

The theory of weak duality seen here states that $p^\ast\ge d^\ast$. *This is true always, even if the original problem is not convex*. We say that strong duality holds if $p^\ast=d^\ast$.

# Slater's sufficient condition for strong duality

Slater's condition is one of many other constraint qualifications conditions, which relate to the *existence of Lagrangian (multipliers)* in a convex optimization problem. Slater's theorem, named after Morton L. Slater, provides a *sufficient condition* for strong duality to hold. Namely, if

- The primal problem is convex;
- It is strictly feasible, that is, there exists $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that
  $$Ax_0=b,\ f_i(x_0)<0,\ i=1,\ldots,m,$$

then, strong duality holds: $p^\ast=d^\ast$, and the dual problem is attained.
