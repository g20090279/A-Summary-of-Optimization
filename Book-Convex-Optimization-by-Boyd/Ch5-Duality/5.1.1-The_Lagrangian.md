Consider an optimization problem in the standard form (Boyd 2009, Eq. (4.1))

$$\begin{aligned}\min\ &f_0(x)\\\text{s. t. }&f_i(x)\leq0,\quad i=1,\dots,m\\&h_i(x)=0,\quad i=1,\dots,p,\end{aligned}$$

in a real-valued number space. Note that this optimization is not necessarily convex. The *Lagrangian (multiplier)* is defined as

$$\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda,v)=f_0(x)+\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_if_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^{p}v_ih_i(x),$$

mapping $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^p$ input to a scalar output. The domain of function $\mathcal{L}(\cdot)$ is $\textbf{dom}\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{D}\times\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^p$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the domain of $x$. The vector $\lambda=[\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_m]^T$ and $v=[v_1,\dots,v_p]^T$ are called the *dual variables*, while $x$ is *primal variable*.

The lagrangian considers the constraints as weighted factors, which are added with the original objective function.
