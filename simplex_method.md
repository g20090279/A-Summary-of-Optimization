## Review of Linear Programming

The *Simplex Method* is used to solve problems related to linear programming, or in another name linear optimization. A linear programming problem is an optimization problem where the objective function and all the constraints are linear. The linear programming can be written in a standard form

$$\begin{aligned}
  \min_{x}\quad&c^Tx\\
  \mathrm{s.t.}\quad&Ax=b,\\
  &x\geq0.
\end{aligned}$$

Here $x\in\R^n$ is a $n\times1$ vector in the field of real number. It is the only variable in this optimization problem. $c\in\R^n$ is a vector with same dimension of $x$. $A\in\R^{m\times n}$ is a $m\times n$ matrix, and $b\in\R^{m}$ is a $m\times1$ vector.
