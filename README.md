# The World of Optimization

In the real world we can encounter many problems where we need to find a optimal solution given an objective function and/or some constraints, especially as an engineerer.

In this repo, during studying the encountered concepts in optimization, we want to mark it down, and draft some summary to help us to understand related topices.
